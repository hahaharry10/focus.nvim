# Aim
perma-hl provides a quick way to highlight segments of text, allowing easy navigation
between screens while maintaining visual focus on important sections.

# Inspiration
In my studies into assembly code I constantly found myself reviewing two files side-
by-side whilst documenting my learning on a third screen. As I switched focus between
the two windows I frequently lost track of the segments I was looking at. I recently
stumbled accross [folke/twilight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/twilight.nvim) which
I thought was a really pretty and peaceful way to dim and focus segments of text. As
a result I created this plugin as an unobtrusive way to focus my attention on
specified areas of text.
